Why Data Structures and Algorithms Are Essential in Handling Large Inventories
->In an inventory management system, efficient data storage and retrieval are vital for several reasons:
1. Scalability: As the inventory grows, the system should handle increased data volume without a 
significant drop in performance.
2. Speed: Quick access to inventory data is crucial for tasks like checking stock levels, processing orders, 
and managing logistics.
3. Memory Efficiency: Optimal use of memory resources ensures that the system can manage large datasets 
without excessive memory usage.

Types of Data Structures Suitable for This Problem
We can use Data Structures like ArrayList, HashMap or TreeMap for the given problem. 
But for the given problem considering the need for efficient access and modifications, HashMap is suitable
due to its average constant time complexity for basic operations.

Add Operation: O(1)
Update Operation: O(1)
Delete Operation: O(1)
