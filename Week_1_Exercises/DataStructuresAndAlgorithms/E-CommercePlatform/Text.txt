Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity as a function of the input size, denoted as O(f(n)). It helps to measure and compare the efficiency of algorithms, particularly in terms of execution time or space usage. It provides a high-level understanding of an algorithm's performance, allowing developers to predict how the algorithm will scale with increasing input sizes.
Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios:


Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
Best Case: Algorithm performs the minimum number of operations in best case. For search operations, this could be finding the target item on the first try.
Average Case: Represents the expected number of operations the algorithm performs for random inputs. It considers all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations.

Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) 
Average Case: O(n) 
Worst Case: O(n) 

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) 
Average Case: O(log n) 
Worst Case: O(log n) 


Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
Binary search is more suitable because it is more efficient regarding the complexity. It has less time complexity than linear search.
